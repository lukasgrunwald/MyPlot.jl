# `MyPlot.jl`

Convenience plotting library, using `PyPlot.jl`. Including this package directly sets up the plotting environment with the default options defined in `std.mplstyle`. The style can be changed later with the `set_style` function. 

Next to `plt` also the seaborn package is exported as `sns`. See documentation for commonly used tips and tricks.
